**Job**: PhD candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago <br>
**Hobby**: Theoretical and computational astrophysics <br>

I explore the universe using whatever tools get the job done - numerical simulations, analytical theory, machine learning, and the occasional deep-dive into observational data.

My PhD thesis, advised by Prof. Nick Gnedin (who, according to himself, is also a movie director), focuses on cosmic reionization. I also spend time up in Madison, WI, working with Prof. Ellen Zweibel on all things cosmic rays.

When I’m not doing science, I’m usually busy building stuff or playing Go. You can find me somewhere between Chicago and Madison (on a Van Galder bus).

<u>For UChicago undergrads interested in theoretical and computational astrophysics:</u> Our group is always excited to welcome undergrads who want to grow as scientists and get involved in modeling structure formation with cosmological simulations. We are typically a good fit for students who enjoy using computing power to tackle physics problems that are too complex for purely analytical solutions. We use simulations as a tool for theoretical discovery. If you're interested, feel free to reach out - and if your email gets lost in the ocean, just drop by our group meeting (Fridays at 3pm in ERC 419).

I started college with a background and interest in physics (in hindsight, applied math) and computer science - mostly from high school competitions and hobby coding. In college classrooms, I found myself drawn to proofs and derivations. I wanted to do theory (though I didn’t know what that really meant), but was told I was too junior and should start with scientific computing - so I did. In grad school, I’ve had the chance to do more theoretical work and came to see that numerical and computational skills are essential for modern astrophysics. That experience shaped how I approach science today: I don’t begin with tools I already know. I start with the intellectual challenge and pick up whatever I need along the way. If I could reassure my undergrad self, it would be this: choose research projects with a clear sense of what skill or perspective you want to develop - and carve your own path from there.
