A short reading guide compiled from my email responses to undergrads and incoming grad students about what my advisor works on and how to get started in the field:

- [Gnedin & Madau (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41115-022-00015-5):  
  A short review that surveys the key physics and modeling approaches used to study cosmic reionization.
- [Saas-Fee Notes (Gnedin 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5184):  
  Lecture notes for anyone interested in starting research in reionization. A guided tour through reionization, galaxy formation, and the physics of cosmic gas â€” from the IGM to star-forming regions.
- [Computational Hydrodynamics for Astrophysics](https://zingale.github.io/cca-summer-school/intro.html):  
  A hands-on introduction to hydrodynamics solvers by Michael Zingale.

For my research, I primarily code in **Python** and **C++**. I've also found **Mathematica** useful in several projects involving more analytical calculations. Additionally, I think a solid grasp of **statistics** is the baseline for producing rigorous research. I took undergraduate major requirements in Computer Science and Statistics, and personally found the core theoretical courses more interesting than most applied ones.

Things I learned before grad school and still reference often in my research:

- [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/)
- [Daniel Baumann's Lecture Notes on Cosmology](http://cosmology.amsterdam/education/cosmology/)

Absolutely tangential, but fun stuff I was interested in that helped shape how I think:

- [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf)
- [The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering: Mastering Complexity](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-011-the-art-of-insight-in-science-and-engineering-mastering-complexity-fall-2014/resources/mitres_6-011f14_art_insfin/)
