Down here at Vänneberga it had one of its last outposts. Beyond it lay Sörbygden where the spiritual life was of another type. There one could both smoke and confess the Savior; there the doctrine of total sinful depravity was preached, and it was said whisky might be found also among the awakened.",

We pictured the meek mild creatures where They dwelt in their strawy pen, Nor did it occur to one of us there To doubt they were kneeling then. So fair a fancy few would weave In these years! Yet, I feel, If someone said on Christmas Eve, “Come; see the oxen kneel, “In the lonely barton by yonder coomb Our childhood used to know,” I should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so.",
